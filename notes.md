# Grid layout - Nexter project
40. we can use line names in repeat function, like this, ``repeat(3, [col-start] 1fr [col-end] )`` which will create ``col-start 1`` to ``col-start 3`` same with ``col-end``.
41. ``grid-template-areas`` is actually easier.
42. dot ( . ) is used to create empty cell.
43. ``grid-auto-rows / columns`` can be used to style implicit grid items.
